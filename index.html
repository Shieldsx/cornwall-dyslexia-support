        <p class="placeholder-text">The British Dyslexia Association (2007) denotes that Dyslexia is a specific learning difficulty that 
            mainly affects the development of literacy and language related skills. It is likely to be present at birth and to be life-long 
            in its effects. It is characterised by difficulties with phonological processing, rapid naming, working memory, processing speed, 
            and the automatic development of skills that may not match up to an individual's other cognitive abilities. It tends to be 
            resistant to conventional teaching methods but its effect can be mitigated by appropriately specific intervention, including the 
            application of information technology and supportive counselling.</p>

        <p>“My son is 10 and in year 5. Although very strong in the Maths and Science side of the curriculum, it was clear that he was 
            falling behind in English – and having followed this up, we received a formal report stating that he had both dysgraphia and 
            dyslexia. Although some individual help was offered at school, this was viewed very negatively by my son – so we looked for 
            alternatives and, following recommendation from the Cornwall Dyslexia Association, found Rachel! Rachel now comes to tutor my 
            son once a week at home – their sessions are relaxed, fun and totally tailor made. Rachel makes the learning process fun – and 
            it is much easier for my son to see his progress from week to week under the guidance of Rachel’s trained eye. We are so glad 
            we found Rachel – I would highly recommend her to any parent and child in a similar situation.”</p>

        <p>"Thank you so much, to say the report was useful would be an understatement. Finally we can help xxxx progress through her 
        education and life in a more positive and understanding way."</p>

        <h4>University Help</h4>
        <p>"I just wanted to let you know that thanks to your report the university have offered me the opportunity to retake the modules I 
        failed in order to progress to my final year. The report gave me all the evidence I needed to support my case and was truly 
        beautifully written. I was touched personally by the final paragraph of the conformation of diagnostic decision.
        This gave me a huge boost in self-belief and I feel it really came through in my appeal so thank you ever so much.
        I know as a professional, you probably see this as just doing your job but if it wasn’t 
        for your willingness to shuffle things around to get me assessed and have the report done quickly, I would have been dropped 
        from my course. Not only have I been offered the best outcome I could have hoped for, but I will also have access to the help 
        I need to do the best I can. I feel so lucky to have got through to you and hope others in your field are learning from you so 
        more students can benefit as I have."</p>

        <p>"Stephanie has been my daughter’s dyslexia and dyspraxia tutor for the past 5 years. She was key to assisting in the 
            diagnosis of my daughter’s dyspraxia providing invaluable advice and guidance. She then put in place a program to assist with 
            her cognitive learning to help her cope with dyspraxia and dyslexia in both the school and at home. Stephanie has been invaluable 
            as a tutor and advisor to both my daughter and our family. Stephanie continues to see our daughter regularly and her expertise in 
            teaching, counselling, and ensuring our daughter both progresses and feels more confident in her abilities has been instrumental. 
            I cannot recommend her enough!"</p>

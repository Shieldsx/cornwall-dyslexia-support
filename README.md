# cornwall-dyslexia-support
This is my first Flagstone project, a website for a local business that offers everything from free advice and support to full diagnostic assessments, including Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA). Throughout this project, I’ll be documenting as much of the process as possible so I can figure out where I shine and where I need to level up—especially when it comes to planning and building responsive, accessible webpages with a solid user experience.
Another big part of this project is the peer feedback and reviews I’ll be getting along the way. I genuinely think that input is going to be huge for me, hearing how others see my work will help me catch things I might miss and push me to improve. I’m also aiming to get a real feel for the whole “plan it first, build it after” workflow, and to see how long different tasks actually take me. That way, I can start understanding how much time I’ll need to set aside for future projects in the real world. This website is a static site, built purely to give users the information they need so they can decide whether this business is the right place for them to request an assessment. The user experience is key here, everything needs to make it clear who Cornwall Dyslexia Support are, what they offer, and how people can get in touch. Since most users these days browse on their phones or tablets far more than on desktops, a mobile-first approach is especially important. The site needs to be fully responsive so the information stays clear, accessible, and easy to navigate on any device. Accessibility will also be a big priority. Since there isn’t a specific target audience, the site needs to stay general, conventional, and friendly for everyone. That means keeping things clear, readable, and easy to navigate, while using proper semantic structure and good design practices so nobody gets lost or excluded—no matter their ability, device, or familiarity with tech.

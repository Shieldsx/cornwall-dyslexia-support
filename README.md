# cornwall-dyslexia-support
This is my first Flagstone project: a website for a local business that provides everything from free advice and support to full diagnostic assessments, including Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA). Throughout the project, I’ll be documenting as much of the process as I can so I can figure out where my strengths actually lie and where I need to level up—especially when it comes to planning and building responsive, accessible webpages with a strong user experience.

A huge part of this journey will be the peer feedback and reviews I receive along the way. I’m expecting that input to be incredibly valuable; seeing my work through someone else’s eyes helps me spot things I might overlook and pushes me to improve. I also want to get a better feel for the whole “plan first, build after” workflow and understand how long different tasks really take. That way, I can start estimating realistic timeframes for future real-world projects.

The site itself is a static website designed purely to give users the information they need so they can decide whether this business is the right place for them to request an assessment. Clear communication is everything here—users need to instantly understand who Cornwall Dyslexia Support are, what they offer, and how they can get in touch.

Since most people these days browse on their phones or tablets more than desktops, a mobile-first approach is essential. The site needs to be fully responsive so the information stays clear, accessible, and easy to navigate on any device.

Accessibility is another major priority. With no specific target audience, the site has to stay general, conventional, and friendly for absolutely everyone. That means keeping everything easy to read and navigate, using proper semantic structure, and following solid design practices so no user feels excluded—regardless of their abilities, their device, or how confident they are with technology.

Taking all of this into account, I’ve kept the design as simple and traditional as possible while still meeting the needs of the site owner and presenting the content they want to showcase. I’ve broken the layout into clear sections that include the client’s requested images and their pre-written content, which helped me judge how much text each part would hold. I’m confident the overall design will feel user-friendly, informative, and accessible.

Responsiveness shouldn’t be an issue either, since the layout stays mostly consistent across all devices. The navigation bar only changes slightly between breakpoints and remains fixed at the top, with a burger menu added on smaller screens—an absolute must, in my opinion. I also chose to place three anchor-link buttons just beneath the main heading and subheading, since the home page is quite long. They should help users jump to key sections without feeling overwhelmed or lost, making navigation smooth and intuitive.

I also wanted to include a light/dark—or even alternative colour—theme switch to make the site more welcoming, especially for users who may be dyslexic or sensitive to certain colour contrasts. The client also requested quotes alongside images, and I agree they help the page feel fuller, more engaging, and a bit inspirational.

Finally, the contact information will be kept very clear, since that’s the main point of interaction between users and the business for arranging assessments and reports. I added a social media bar at the bottom as an optional finishing touch; even though the client doesn’t currently use social media, it’s good to demonstrate that I’m able to implement it if needed in the future.

I made my wireframe designs using Figma. Despite already being familiar with Figma, I struggled to adapt and work with the multiple-screen-canvas format they provide so I think next time I will try out Balsamiq instead.

Target Audience - 
The target audience includes anyone who feels they may benefit from support, whether that’s free advice, general guidance, or full diagnostic assessments, including Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA). Essentially, it’s for users who are looking for clarity, reassurance, or formal assessment options.

SEO - 
To improve searchability and help potential users actually find the site, I added a site description and other key metadata to the <head> of the index.html file. This boosts SEO, gives search engines clearer context, and supports the site’s overall visibility online.

Project outcomes I hope to achieve:

- Design and develop a static website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Apply user experience, accessability and resposiveness princibles.
- Test and deploy the website through all development stages.
- Use documentation and structure to ensure maintainability.
- Deploy the final site to a GitHub Pages.
- Demonstrate version control using GitHub.

Project Goals:

Project Features:

Design Details: Colour pallet, colour picker, font awesome, a colour contrast checker

Naviagation Structure: There will be a consistent Nav Bar horizontally formed at the top of the page on all devices, displaying a row of links for the desktop and a dropdown burger menu for the tablet and mobile.
